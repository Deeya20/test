            <h3>At a Glance:</h3>
            <p>I am beginner to UI/UX design(had no real project) and chose an e-commerce project with Chatgpt’s help. I
                worked for a week on this project named Virtushop an app selling three main product
                categories(electronics & gadgets, Home appliance and Fashion). While I did not finish the entire design,
                I completed 50%.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text2 text">
            <h3>Project Objective:</h3>
            <p>The primary Objective of Virtushop was to design an ecommerce app that makes user experience easy by
                providing distinct pages for each of its three main categories. This will simplify the overall user
                journey, promoting a straightforward and efficient shopping experience. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text3 text">
            <h3>User Research:</h3>
            <p>Since I did not had a team or client to chat with, I took a different route for Virtushop’s research like
                followings: </p>
            <div class="twolist">
                <h4 class="list">
                    <li>Collaborating with ChatGpt:</li>

                </h4>
                <p class="list">I talked to ChatGpt to get ideas and simulate user interaction. I know it wont be like
                    real
                    interview, but it helped me with various things like what e-commerce app should have or how it
                    should work.</p>
            </div>
            <h4 class="list">
                <li>Inspired By Other App:</li>

            </h4>
            <p class="list">I looked at various app like amazon and daraz to see how successful one works. For this
                project
                I did install daraz app and made account to understand how each element works like after entering app
                what
                home page looks, what happens when product is clicked and many more.
                The way of learning might be different, but its only way of making Virtushop the best I can do.</p>

            <h3>Usability Test:</h3>
            <p>As there was no real project and client, I conducted a usability test with my 3 friends who are learning
                frontend development(because they will have some knowledge about Figma and UI). They used prototype I
                shared through Figma. Based on their feedbacks, I made some improvement:

                <li class="feed">Using other secondary color for text instead using only black and white for better
                    readability.</li>

                <li class="feed">Highlighting categories to make it easier for user to navigate.</li>

                <li class="feed">Adding popup message after user click add to cart button for more interactive
                    experience.
            </p>
            </li>

            <h3>What I Learned:</h3>
            <p>This is my first project with both UI/UX before I used to focus on UI. With this journey I figured out
                how to research, listen and implement feedbacks and work on a project. It made me better at what I used
                to do and helped me see how UI/UX works together.</p>
