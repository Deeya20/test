            <h3>At a Glance:</h3>
            <p>I found the Face 2 Face NTC SIM activation app's user experience wasnt as good as Ncell's app which i was
                already familier
                with. So, I decided to redesign some unsatisfied part of th app to improve its usability. It took me one
                week to complete
                the work.
            </p>

        <div class="text2 text">
            <h3>Project Objective:</h3>
            <p>The primary Objective of the project was to redesign the face 2 face app to improve user satisfaction and
                streamline the activation process. This will make both the seller and buyer's overall experience
                efficient. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text3 text">
            <h3>User Research:</h3>
            <p>To start, redesign of the app, it was essential to gather insights and feedback from individual who
                regularly
                interacted with the original app </p>
            <div class="twolist">
                <h4 class="list">
                    <li>Methodology:</li>

                </h4>
                <p class="list">I conducted user research by directly engaging with family members who use the orignal
                    app regularly.
                </p>

                <h4 class="list">
                    <li>Participant selection:</li>

                </h4>
                <p class="list">participation included myself,my father and my two uncles, all of whom are shop owners and frequent
                    user of the face 2 face app.
                   .</p>
                <h4 class="list">
                    <li>Inspired By Other App:</li>

                </h4>
                <p class="list">In addition to gathering feedback on the existing app,inspiration was drawn from the Ncell app 
                    whic I used at very first time and knew how to use it pretty well as compare to NTC.By comparing the two apps,
                    I got some rought idea what I should do and valuable insights to inform the redesign of the NTC app.

            <h3>Usability Test:</h3>
            <p>I conducted usability testing by comparing the original app with my redesign version with my family members as mention above
                including myself,who use the app on daily basis. As a regular user of the original app, my feedbacks along with theirs
                provided valuable insights for the redesign process.Some improvements:

                <li class="feed">Using white navigation icons  rather than grey with blue theme to improve visibilty
                    and maintain consistency </li>

                <li class="feed">Placing the document upload option before the form for easier content scanning and automatic
                    filling with correction capabilities.
                </li>

                <li class="feed">In submitted record,highlighting the entire column in red as warning when sim is not activated,
                    eliminating the need for horizontal scrolling to locate the status indication.
            </p>
            </li>

            <h3>What I Learned:</h3>
            <p>During this project,I learned the importance of understanding user needs and preferences, iteratively
                refining based on user input helped enhance usability, highlighting the feedback and implementing it.
